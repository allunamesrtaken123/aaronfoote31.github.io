I've tried to compile all of the helpful resources for applying to graduate schools that I've come across in my own searches. It's not particularly organized, but it includes
information on setting the right intention, identifying schools, applying for fellowships, and frequent difficulties of graduate school. Given my interests in statistics and 
computer science, most of these resources are from professors in those fields.
